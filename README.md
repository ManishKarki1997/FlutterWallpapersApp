# Wallpapers App

A simple wallpaper app I made to learn flutter, this time using an API.

My other app - simple offline note taking app with dark mode - is available here [FlutterNotesApp](https://github.com/ManishKarki1997/FlutterNotesApp)

## Backend

Backend is my own node server that scrapes Wallhaven and serves the api for the wallpapers

Github for the backend [WallpapersAPI](https://github.com/ManishKarki1997/WallpapersAPI)

## Getting Started

```

Change directory in to the folder

```

```
